        prompt2: "What's up, Blue?",
        prompt3: "...Blue?",
        prompt4: "Er, right. Well, you must have traveled a lot in your old line of work, yes?",
        prompt5: "Sure did! Us thieves tend to outstay our welcome in a hurry.",
        prompt6: "The reason I ask is that I've had little chance to see the world properly.",
        prompt7: "I've journeyed on diplomatic business, but that's pretty much it.",
        prompt8: "And frankly, one majestic court looks very much like another.",
        prompt9: "I've often wondered what it would be like to roam the world free of royal burdens.",
        prompt10: "Ha! You royals up in your pointy towers really don't have a clue!",
        prompt11: "You think us commoners are free to just spend our days sauntering along!",
        prompt12: "Think we pick daisies and gaze at tourist attractions and eat bonbons all day!",
        prompt13: "Look, that's not what I was implying at all. ...And I think you know it.",
        prompt14: "So what's the problem? Tired of silk pants and the undying adoration of the masses?",
        prompt15: "I try to appreciate my situation, but being a royal can be incredibly...stifling.",
        prompt16: "It's a comfortable prison, true, but a prison nonetheless.",
        prompt17: "Sounds like a serious case of not being able to count your blessings.",
        prompt18: "It's trueâ€”I'm never hungry, I've a hot bath and a warm bed, people leap to my aid...",
        prompt19: "Perhaps you're right. What right have I to complain of such a life?",
        prompt20: "Bingo.",
