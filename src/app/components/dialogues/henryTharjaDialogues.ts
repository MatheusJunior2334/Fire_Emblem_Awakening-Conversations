        prompt1: "I know you.",
        prompt2: "You do?",
        prompt3: "When I still fought for Plegia, we heard all sorts of stories about you.",
        prompt4: "A silver-haired youth with a knowledge of curses and an extraordinary gift for magic.",
        prompt5: "A man guarded by fierce crows so that very few had seen the true extent of his powers.",
        prompt6: "Oh wow! Now that's a reputation!",
        prompt7: "Yeah, crows have always had a thing for me, I guess. Dunno why.",
        prompt8: "Perhaps you'd be willing to teach a trick or two to a fellow dark mage?",
        prompt9: "Sure! You want me to cast a death curse on someone?",
        prompt10: "Someone in camp? Mmm... No. That could be problematic.",
        prompt11: "Hee hee! Yeah, I guess. Too bad, though.",
        prompt12: "See, 'cause I've got one that makes blood come out yourâ€”",
        prompt13: "Thank you, I get the picture.",
        prompt14: "What's with the smiling, anyway?",
        prompt15: "No one's going to trust you if you're grinning like the village idiot.",
        prompt16: "Hee hee! Smiling? This is how I always look.",
        prompt17: "Hardly reassuring. Tell me what you're plotting and I may yet spare you.",
        prompt18: "Sorry! Nothing sinister over here. I'm just a hale and hearty mage.",
        prompt19: "Ugh... Hale? Hearty? Have you no respect for our ancient profession?",
        prompt20: "We're supposed to be harbingers of pestilence and famine and doom!",
        prompt21: "Mm... I love doom."
