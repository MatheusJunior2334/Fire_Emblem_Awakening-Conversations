        prompt1: "Ah, Gaius. Weren't you wearing those exact clothes yesterday?",
        prompt2: "That a problem?",
        prompt3: "And unless I'm very much mistaken, you also wore them the day before that.",
        prompt4: "Yeah, well, this is my favourite outfit.",
        prompt5: "Why are you so interested in my attire? You fancy me or something?",
        prompt6: "I'm simply trying to offer a piece of friendly advice here.",
        prompt7: "Perhaps you don't realize that you look and smell like the floor of a tavern.",

        prompt10: "Not to mention your hair needs a trim and you have crumbs stuck to your face.",

        prompt13: "Well, as long as it's not slowing me down on the battlefield, right?",
        prompt14: "I'm not some fancywaist who needs to strut about like a peacock.",
        prompt15: "Well, perhaps you should consider it regardless.",
        prompt16: "All right, all right. Message received. I'll put on some new clothes, mother.",
        prompt17: "Don't forget to comb your hair.",
        prompt18: "And wash those old clothes in vinegar, or you'll never get the smell out.",
        prompt19: "...I'm going now.",
        prompt20: "Once washed, if you want to reduce the wrinkles, take a willow reed and...",
        prompt21: "Hey! Don't walk away when I'm talking about laundry!",
